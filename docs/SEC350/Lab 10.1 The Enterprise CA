# Lab Summary

In this lab we are installing a certificate authority on the new Rocky Linux system called ca. This is so certificates can be signed and issued to nginx and http services can be migrated to https/tls

### ad/dns

* First thing that we need to do is Configure mgmt02 to be a Windows Domain Controller(yourname.local)
* Configure forward and reverse dns records for all hosts except traveler and wks1
* For edge01 use the LAN IP
* for fw-mgmt use the MGMT IP
* join wks1 to the domain
 -This will require an initially permissive set of LAN-to-MGMT rules such that the  172.16.150.0/24 subnet can initiate connections to the DC

### ca

* Goes on the MGMT Network with IP Address of 172.16.200.12/28
* Name it ca-yourname
* reset root password
* create a named sudo user
* put it in DNS
* Should only be able to access the system from mgmt01 using ssh, this will require host firewall rules that restrict by source address and destination port/protocol
* a LAN-to-MGMT rule for CA management from mgmt01
